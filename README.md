# STABLE ENOUGH ðŸ˜‚

The purpose of what i have made comes as follows:

          The basic goal of this is to manuever through a
          .txt file. Upon finding a line with "sold" in it
          i want to document the name of the person who sent
          the message and what item number they have purchased.
          
          The formatting for the message is usually as follows:
          
          [TIMESTAMP] From SENDER to RECIPIANT: [MESSAGE]
         
          And every line contains this format. However...
          
          Extracting the "sold" is a little more complicated
          as we have instructed the senders to send "sold" in
          the chat in this format.
          
          SOLD [ITEM NUMBER]
          
          Unfortunately, they may put it in the reverse order or explain 
          specifically what they want surrounding this key format in a
          wall of text.
          
          My main challenge is to extract these numbers so that these
          numbers can be exported into an excel sheet in the format.
